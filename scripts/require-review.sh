#
# The point is that the review happens BEFORE the reviewer sees the branch: a
# defect found here costs minutes; found by the reviewer it costs a round.
#
# The receipt, and the verify step after this in the hook, are about HEAD. As
# the pre-push hook, git writes the refs being pushed to stdin; a push of any
# other commit (`git push origin other-branch`) is refused, or a clean receipt
# for this branch would carry an unreviewed one out. Run by hand with nothing on
# stdin, it judges HEAD. Tested by src/testing/push-gates.test.ts.
