# Requests both reviewers of record on a pull request, for its current head:
#   - GitHub Copilot code review, as a formal reviewer (re-requesting after a
#     push asks it to review the new head);
#   - Codex, through an `@codex review` comment -- it is a GitHub App, and the
#     review-request API only accepts collaborators, so a comment is the only
#     way to ask it.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/request-review.sh [pr-number] [scope note]
#   pr-number   defaults to the pull request of the current branch
#   scope note  e.g. "confirmation round: fix commits since abc1234, fix-now only"
